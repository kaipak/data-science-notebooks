# Notebook Experiments
Hopefully, this will be a way to preserve all the experimental work I do in 
notebook environments, without having the markup output litter git logs with 
not terribly useful changelogs. Some of the material in these notebooks will 
be used for blogs and tutorials that are developed elsewhere in my GitHub 
account. It might be useful to find some initial work in here, but in general, 
there is little polish to the work in here and mostly meant as a kind of 
scratch coding area.
